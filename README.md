# bash-srp-alpha
A STALKER-centered RP gamemode for Garry's Mod.

This repository contains the base gamemode for the #!/BASH/SRP Alpha. Associated content and addons are listed below, and are generally required to run the gamemode successfully out-of-the-box.

This is a collection of code that spans nearly two years of development; it contains code I wrote when I was just learning the ins-and-outs of programming. This is by no means a stable, optimized release. If bugs come up, they will be fixed. However, any new, significant framework changes will be channeled into the Beta version. Browse and play with this as you like, but use it publicly at your own discretion.
